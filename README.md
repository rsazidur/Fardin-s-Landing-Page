# DeviceFix — Landing Page

This is a simple static landing page scaffold modeled after a phone/device repair site.

Open `index.html` in your browser to view locally.

If you want to connect forms to a server, replace the `alert()` in `script.js` with a `fetch()` call to your endpoint.

Files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styles
- `script.js` — small form handlers

Assets:
- `assets/logo.svg` — placeholder logo (kept as fallback)
- `assets/photo1.svg`, `photo2.svg`, `photo3.svg`, `photo4.svg` — gallery placeholders (kept as fallback)
- `Photos/` — your uploaded images. If you place `logo.jpg` and `wall.jpg` here they will be used automatically.
